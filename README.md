# TTSSE-Lab1
Dummy repo for TTSSE Lab - on version control

This is a simple Python program that identifies and prints all prime numbers within a specified range. In this version, the range is set from 1 to 1000.

📋 Description
The program includes a function to check whether a given number is prime. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to 1000 and prints each number that is identified as prime.

🧠 How It Works
A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

The program uses an optimized method by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

All prime numbers in the range are printed to the console.

🛠️ Functions
is_prime(number): Returns True if the number is prime, False otherwise.

main(): Iterates through the numbers from 1 to 1000 and prints the prime ones.

▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the program with:
python prime.py
